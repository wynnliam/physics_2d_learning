/*
  A lazy utility to be able to include both 2D and 3D vector
  definitions into your class. Once could argue this isn't
  principled - it's something I don't often do. But as I've
  developed my skills as a C programmer, like Mr. Kurtz I've
  sort of become a C-native using C-isms and devolving into
  a C-savage.
