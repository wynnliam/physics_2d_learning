# Simple 2D Physics Engine
A simple 2D physics engine for learning purposes. Engine is built out as I complete
the [2D Game Physics Programming](https://pikuma.com/courses/game-physics-engine-programming) course
from Pikuma.

I will somewhat buck the trends of this course by doing it *exclusively* in C++, whereas the course
does some parts in Javascript or something.
